## üîê Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## üë• User Roles

- **User (1)**: Can purchase tickets, transfer tickets, view payment history
- **Seller (2)**: Can create events, manage tickets and sales, view revenue
- **Admin (3)**: Can approve/reject events, view system statistics

## üí≥ Payment System

The payment system is **mocked** for development purposes:

- All payments are simulated with 90% success rate
- No real money transactions occur
- Payment methods supported: Card, PayPal, Google Pay
- Failed payments return appropriate error messages

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Clean Architecture

The project follows clean architecture principles:

1. **Models**: Core business entities
2. **Repositories**: Data access layer with interfaces
3. **Services**: Business logic layer
4. **Handlers**: HTTP presentation layer
5. **Middleware**: Cross-cutting concerns

### Database Schema

Key relationships:
- Users can have multiple roles (User, Seller, Admin)
- Sellers can create multiple Events
- Events can have multiple Tickets through Sales
- Users can purchase Tickets (PurchasedTickets)
- Tickets can be transferred between users

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Default: 100 requests per minute per IP
- Configurable in middleware
- Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage

### Database Optimization
- Connection pooling configured
- Proper indexing on foreign keys
- Pagination for list endpoints

### Caching Strategy
- Redis caching
- JWT token validation caching
- Event data caching for high-traffic scenarios

## üîí Security Features

### Input Validation
- Email format validation
- Password strength requirements
- Username format validation
- Request payload validation

### Authentication Security
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Refresh token mechanism
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based access control

### API Security
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Request logging
- Panic recovery

## üöß Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- [ ] Email notifications for events
- [ ] Event search and filtering
- [ ] User reviews and ratings
- [ ] Real payment integration
- [ ] Event categories and tags
- [ ] Bulk ticket operations

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Redis caching implementation
- [ ] Comprehensive admin dashboard
- [ ] API documentation with Swagger
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Advanced logging with structured logs
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] WebSocket for real-time updates

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)

# Security Scanning & Code Quality

This project includes comprehensive security scanning using **Gosec** for Go-specific vulnerabilities and **SonarQube** for code quality analysis. All security findings are integrated into a single SonarQube dashboard for easy monitoring.

## üöÄ Quick Start
